Six months ago today I moved from a small town in southwest Virginia to New York City. I came up here with just a duffel bag, a suitcase, and a backpack. I slept on an air mattress in my friend’s living room in Bushwick for three weeks until I was able to move into an apartment in Brooklyn Heights. I sold my car, got rid of a third of my wardrobe, and moved to a city that’s basically the opposite of the place I had been living for the past six years. After working at a digital advertising agency for almost three years, I decided that I wanted to switch industries and quit my first job as an adult. To say my life has been full of changes in the past six months would be quite the understatement.


A week after I moved up here, I went to the Future of Web Design conference and [saw Tina Roth Eisenberg speak](https://vimeo.com/34569711). The whole talk was incredible, but the timing of her talk was what meant the most to me. One of her rules was “If an opportunity scares you, you need to take it”.

Nothing about moving here has been easy, but everything has been worth it. I can’t wait to see where I am six months from now.
