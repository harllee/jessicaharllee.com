I'm excited to announce that on December 12th I'll be a seller in the first-ever [Emoji Pop-up Market](http://www.emojishow.com/market/) as part of the [Emoji Art and Design Show](http://www.emojishow.com). I've been embroidering emoji day and night in preparation and will be selling thumbs ups, poops, and dancers. Come by to check out the art show, say hi, and buy some handcrafted emoji!
