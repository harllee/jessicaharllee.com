[Catt Small](http://cattsmall.com) and I recently did an interview with [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog) for their interview series Inside Design. We spoke about what it was like designing for Etsy's buyers and sellers and our design team culture. We also had a super fun photoshoot slash brainstorming session with our design teammates in Brooklyn Bridge Park!
