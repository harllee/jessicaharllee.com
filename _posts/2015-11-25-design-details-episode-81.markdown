[Bryn Jackson](https://twitter.com/uberbryn) and [Brian Lovin](https://twitter.com/brian_lovin) run [Design Details](http://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details), an interview podcast with designers. They came to Etsy to do a recording of a panel-style interview with me, [Justin Edmond](https://twitter.com/jedmund), and [Joel Califa](https://twitter.com/notdetails). It was super fun but a little scaryâ€”it was recorded in front of a live audience! I had a ton of fun talking about things like how we all became designers, management vs. individual contributor roles, and Neopets.
