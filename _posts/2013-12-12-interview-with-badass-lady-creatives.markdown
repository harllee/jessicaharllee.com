I spoke with Melanie Richards from [Badass Lady Creatives](http://baladycreatives.com) in an [interview published on Design Work Life](http://www.designworklife.com/2013/12/11/interview-with-product-designer-jessica-harllee/).


My favorite part was probably when she asked me what my favorite recent project was; I started thinking about Kickstarter projects then realized she meant actual design projects that I've worked on. Working at Kickstarter has forever changed the meaning of the word 'project' for me!
