I can be really bad at stopping to reflect on my accomplishments, but so much has happened this year that I feel really great about. Here are some things from the past year of which I'm most proud (in no particular order):


> - I [redesigned my site](http://jessicaharllee.com/notes/a-redesign-with-siteleaf/), which we all know is a taxing process.
- I have a lot more confidence in my development skills. My skillset is no longer skewed heavily toward Photoshop and mockups and is much more well-rounded.
- I went to [great](https://twitter.com/harllee/status/339768991964880896) [conferences](https://twitter.com/xoxo/status/388329269144727552) and met some really amazing people (as someone who is painfully introverted, this is a huge accomplishment).
- I have a [personal project](http://jessicaharllee.com/work/emoji-embroidery/) that doesn't involve a computer.
- I [sold something that I made](http://jessicaharllee.com/notes/emoji-embroidery-a-post-mortem/).
- I taught an [online class](http://jessicaharllee.com/work/skillshare-wireframing-classes/) with hundreds of students.
- I saved more money than I ever have before.
- I exercised (mostly) regularly.

I already have some pretty big plans for the coming year. 2014 is going to be huge.
