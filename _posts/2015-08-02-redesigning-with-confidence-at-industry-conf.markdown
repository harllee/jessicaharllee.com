This past April I spoke at [Industry Conf](https://industryconf.com) in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. Industry Conf covers practical topics about the web, ranging from research to design to backend development.

I spoke about two major redesigns that we did at Etsy, a redesign of our seller onboarding and the [Listings Manager redesign](http://jessicaharllee.com/work/etsy-listings-manager/), and contrasted the different methods we used to gain confidence in the major changes we made.
