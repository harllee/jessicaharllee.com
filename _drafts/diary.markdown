About a year ago, I started a diary. Moving to New York was harder than I thought it'd be; I thrive on familiarity and had spent the past six years in a small town in Virginia building a circle of friends and a routine. No topic was left untouched, from the city to my job to boys to my stupid landlord.

One of the drawers in my nighttable is dedicated to old sketchbooks. While reorganizing my apartment one day, I came across a diary that I had started my freshman year of college.

Writing is indeed therapy. Many people are more at ease sharing things that make them uncomfortable or things that inspire them, whereas I'm not quite prepared for the vulnerability caused by sharing diary-worthy material. 
sharing for future self
shyness, vulnerablility
