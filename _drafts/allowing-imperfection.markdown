Jessica Harllee:
	hahaha awesome!
	How that would translate to web design is beyond me at this point, but anything’s possible.
	very real talk, i like it
Erin Nolan:
	thanks
Jessica Harllee:
	i spent like two hours on pinterest last night
Erin Nolan:
	i need to get over this fear of being perfect
Jessica Harllee:
	i knowwww!!! i feel like it’s something i constantly struggle with
Erin Nolan:
	i really like my old blog posts from college, so trying to get back to that. shitty photos, real blog posts
Jessica Harllee:
	haha yeah totally
	too much self-inflicted pressure
Erin Nolan:
	what were you looking at on pinterest
Jessica Harllee:
	just scrolling through my feed at first
Erin Nolan:
	I was inspired by this post on gluten free girl.com... omg LOL i didn’t even notice the url until now: http://glutenfreegirl.com/2013/11/fuck-pinterest/
Jessica Harllee:
	and then i started searching “window sill” because i have them now and don’ know what to do with them
	but i feel like i’ve been looking at lots of midcentury too
Erin Nolan:
	“When I first picked up a digital camera, I felt the same way I did when I touched that clunky computer in 1983. My fingers thrilled to it. I pointed it somewhere in the room and looked for light. It’s always the light I want to find. But somehow, picking up the much more expensive digital camera now has become tangled up with making photographs look good enough for Pinterest and making sure the recipe I’m posting has the right hashtags to gather enough views to make sure we have enough readers to keep growing.

And I’m right back in goddamned high school, where everyone is pretty miserable and trying so horribly hard to fake it to everyone around them.”
	that’s awesome LOL
Jessica Harllee:
	wow awesome
Erin Nolan:
	brb olive is crying
Jessica Harllee:
	aw~
	when i was working on my embroidery i was thinking a lot about perfection
	i should write this down
	but
	in college i didn’t have money for fonts or the technical ability to draw something perfectly so i worked that into the style so everything looked a little fucked up so you wouldn’t notice that i couldn’t draw or whatever
	and now everything is supposed to be so perfect all the time
	that it felt kind of nice to go back to a hand-made, rough around the edges kind of look
	that wasn’t just a look but the way that it actually was
	
web design: pixels, lots of math, functions all make it technically possible to make things perfect
