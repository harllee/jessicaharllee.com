This isn't about the albums that were my first CD or my first concert or whatever. These albums made me feel alive and the pain of relationships and everything amazing and awful in between. Most of them came at really important times in my life and probably meant more because of that than anything else.


Incubus, Morning View


Thrice, The Artist in the Ambulance
http://rd.io/x/QVkUByJczsM/

I think this album is singlehandedly responsible for me becoming a designer. I vividly remember the packaging (a series of cards, one for each song, that had unique artwork on one side and lyrics on the other) and the grungey style was what I styled all of my websites after for years. It didn't hurt that the album is fantastic and was all I sang at the top of my lungs while driving around in my 2001 Nissan Altima. This album made me feel tough.

Cursive, Ugly Organ
When I first really starting keeping a sketchbook, it was mostly illustrations of this album. I was in a weird point in my life with relationships. The music is really rough, really awkward, and a little ugly at times, but something about that really matched what I was feeling.


Ashlee Simpson, Autobiography
http://rd.io/x/QVkUByJbjpo/

This was the first 'mainstream' album that I actually liked. I was so obsessed with being non-comformist that it was a weird relief to enjoy something so simple and carefree. I have intense memories of driving around in my friend's Bronco while blasting this with a bunch of ladies. Clearly led to many Lady Gaga and Beyonce and listens later.


Minus the Bear, Menos El Oso
http://rd.io/x/QVkUByJ1D60/

This album came out right as I went to college 4 hours away from home, when my high school boyfriend and I broke up fo the first time, and when I was probably really discovering who I was. I used to listen to this album while walking to class. 'Drilling' was my #1 played song on iTunes for years.


Broken Social Scene, self-titled
It took me a long time to really appreciate BSS. They've come to be one of my favorite bands, but the chaotic music was really off-putting at first. 


Brand New, The Devil and God are Raging Inside of Me
http://rd.io/x/QVkUByJcO_4/

When I think of albums that really impacted me, this is at the top of the list. Brand New came out with a more mature sound right when I  was maturing, and something about the darker lyrics really struck a chord (no pun intended). I have vivid memories of thrifting in Blacksburg, playing around in sculpture class, and struggling to make sense of relationships while listening to this album.


Jenny Lewis, Acid Tongue

I spent many many years following Jenny Lewis and/or Rilo Kiley around the East coast. None of her other albums struck me the way that Acid Tongue did; something about the timing was just right. There's nothing like belting out "The Next Messiah" while speeding down a mountain on the way to the river in the summertime.


Metric, Fantasties
This album made me feel weak and powerful all at once. Something about the way Emily Haines sings on it turns me into a bubbling mess of emotion.

Girl Talk, Feed the Animals
http://rd.io/x/QVkUByJ_SZ8/

This album was the first that made me realize that music could be interactive instead of passive. The first time I felt comfortable dancing in public was at a Girl Talk show in Asheville, North Carolina, and it was the most freeing experience. It also led me to appreciate rap and hip hop more than I ever had before.


Pretty Lights, Passing By Behind Your Eyes
http://rd.io/x/QVkUByJ5RhA/

This album came out after I graduated college, when I was living in a small town that had a decent dubstep/D&B/electronic scene. Pretty Lights shows have been some of the most freeing shows that I've been to; I even traveled to Boulder to see them once. This is one of their best albums.


Geographer, Myth
http://rd.io/x/QVkUByJKCsE/

I discovered this album when I think I was in a really transitional period of my life. There's a lot of emotion in this album that can be really striking. Something about the timing of listening to this album always seemed really on-point.
