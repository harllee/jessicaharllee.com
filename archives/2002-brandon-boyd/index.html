Sorry for the lack of updates.. there's been a lot going on recently. I'm really stressed out. I downloaded <a href="#">Greymatter</a> and with the help of <a href="#">nlc</a>, installed it. I'm working on customizing it, so I won't actually use it for a bit. My <a href="#">Guestbook</a> finally works again, Getstring was down for awhile. Yay :]<br><a href="#">Jessica</a> | <a href="#">G-book</a> | <a href="#">Plugging</a><br><br>

Tyler and I were talking on the phone last night in secret.. and I fell asleep. Poor guy. We were talking and I put down the phone cause I heard my mom.. and instantly fell asleep. Whoops. I have so much homework in World Civ, it's not funny. 21 days, and then school is over. Thank God. Everyone needs to go visit <a href="#">Derek</a> cause he is a cool kid. He listens to good music :] We both decided that it's hard to talk to webmasters without sounding like stalkers. I mean, there are so many people I would want to IM and go on and on about how I visit their site daily, etc, but I would sound like I have no life and that I stalk them insanely. Even though it's true that I have no life.. but that's another story.<br><a href="#">Jessica</a> | <a href="#">G-book</a> | <a href="#">Plugging</a><br><br>

So I added a little thing where you can "tour" my room. Woohoo. Even though it's not that interesting, but whatever. If you have any suggetions as to what content I should add/remove, please please please tell me. Feedback is always very helpful. Just use the form on the left. I've noticed that I ate a lot today. Snacked, actually. I have no clue why. The only times when I eat a lot are when it's that time of the month, or when I'm upset about something. I can rule out the first one. Am I upset about something? I have no idea. Maybe it's the massive amount of projects/homework/etc that I have due in the next two weeks? Hmm. P.S. My <a href="#">Guestbook</a> is feeling lonely. James, aka Thedudeknownasjimbo, you are officially my best friend.<br><a href="#">Jessica</a> | <a href="#">G-book</a> | <a href="#">Plugging</a><br><br>

Just got back from Mother's Day dinner. Kinda boring.. but oh well. I got a belated birthday present from my aunt, uncle and cousin. A $75 gift certificate to Gap. I'm going to have to go shopping sometime soon :] Today was pretty uneventful. I have to write a speech by Tuesday. Luckily it's only the draft, or else I would be in deep poop. If I have time and my computer doesn't freeze, I'll put up a tour of my room. Spiffy, eh?<br><a href="#">Jessica</a> | <a href="#">G-book</a> | <a href="#">Plugging</a><br><br>

Ack. Sorry that nothing's been up in about a week. My computer has been a huge pain in the ass. It's not even funny. Random freezing.. not letting me open up some programs. Ugh. Plus, I realized that somehow my main folder where I keep all of my stuff got deleted. Luckily, none of the stuff for this site got deleted. But all of my photos, fonts.. I hate computers sometimes. So anyways, this layout <b>was</b> going to be put up at the beginning of the week in honor of the Incubus concert last night, but whatever. Speaking of which, the concert was so amazing. Hoobastank opened, and I got pretty close to them. Right on the outskirts of the mosh pit. They were pretty good. Then for Incubus, I wasn't very close, but I still had an awesome time. I got so in to it, heh, I was dancing and jumping like a fool. Lol. But it was all in good fun. Plus, they played all of my favorite songs. *Sigh* Incubus is so great.<br><a href="#">Jessica</a> | <a href="#">G-book</a> | <a href="#">Plugging</a><br><br>
