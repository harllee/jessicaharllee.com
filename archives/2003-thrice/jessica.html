<div class="text"><p align="justify">i'm sixteen years old and a sophomore at a high school in northern virginia. brown hair and brown eyes, very short (4'11) but "well proportioned," as my mom says. i'm not too athletic, but i enjoy running - i'm run winter and spring track. i love music, but you probably figured that considering everyone in the 'internet world' is obsessed with music. i'm pretty random, and moody as hell. i'm scared of the responsiblity that comes with growing up. i'm also scared of heights, fire, death, and insects. when i'm not at school/running, i'm on the computer. because i have no life. when i grow up i want to work with computers, specifically graphic design. i think it would be so awesome to design band shirts, cd covers, or something similar to that. organized religion makes no sense to me, as does smoking, drugs, or drinking. why do something that harms your body so much? i'm probably the only person in the world who never watches television. sex and the city, however, is brilliant.<br><br>
