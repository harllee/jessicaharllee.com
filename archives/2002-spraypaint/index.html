	Sorry there haven't been any updates recently. I've been so busy with school and stuff, I've had a lot of make up work from when I was sick, and a lot of homework. Plus, I haven't gotten a lot of sleep at all this week, so I needed to spend the time that I had working on homework so I could go to bed earlier. Plus, on top of that, my internet is down, so I can't go on my computer that much. What fun. Thank God the week is almost over. I really need sleep and rest. Yeah, about my drama project, we definitely didn't have it ready by the day it was due. Long story, but we couldn't access any editing equipment over spring break. In class, he chooses groups to go, and Monday we didn't have the video, but we luckily didn't get called to go. So the girl who was doing the editing said she would do it by the next class. But, she didn't have it then cause another member of our group didn't give her the camera. So, finally, we're going to have it for tomorrow (next drama class) and I hope it turns out okay! Cross your fingers!<br><a href="#">Jessica</a> | <a href="#">Guestbook</a> | <a href="#">Plugging</a><br><br>

	Alright, so I've been as bored as hell all day. Nothing to do. Tyler's been out, so I've been sitting here, on my ass. Doing nothing. Now I'm waiting for him to get back home and call me. What a day..<br><a href="#">Jessica</a> | <a href="#">Guestbook</a> | <a href="#">Plugging</a><br><br>

	Okay, so maybe the preloading images didn't work. I got a new preloading thing, let's see if <b>this</b> works..<br><a href="#">Jessica</a> | <a href="#">Guestbook</a> | <a href="#">Plugging</a><br><br>

	I added a preloading images script.. cause the images take a while to load for the layout, so hopefully this will make things a bit easier for you. I went over to Tyler's today, we exchanged gifts. He gave me a really pretty necklace to match the bracelet he gave me for Valentine's Day, he wrote me a really nice note, and gave me the military ball picture in a frame. I'm going to Baltimore for Passover tomorrow, and I won't be back until Saturday, so don't expect any updates. Gotta go get ready for bed, see ya.<br><a href="#">Jessica</a> | <a href="#">Guestbook</a> | <a href="#">Plugging</a><br><br>

	<b>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TYLER!</b> Today for Tyler's birthday me, Tyler, his mom, his sister, and his mom's boyfriend all went out to lunch at Dave and Buster's. It's a really cool restaurant where there are games and stuff.. kinda like a Chuck E. Cheese for adults. Tyler got 1600 tickets and I got 1000, and he gave me his so I could get a giant stuffed blue M&M. I kept refusing and stuff, cause I mean it's his birthday, I don't want to take all of his tickets, but he wouldn't listen to me. What a sweetie :] Tomorrow I'm going over to his dad's house, and I'm giving him his birthday/anniversary gift and he's giving me my anniversary gift, then we're going to watch a movie and stuff. Oh, if you couldn't tell, I put up a new layout. It's kinda random, and graphically it's not amazing, but I like the colors. I got my braces tightened yesterday, and they put some random wires on them, so I can't eat anything at all. Fun. Speaking of food, time for dinner. See ya.<br><a href="#">Jessica</a> | <a href="#">Guestbook</a> | <a href="#">Plugging</a><br><br>

	<b>About:</b> This website opened in August, 2001 with <a href="#">Angelfire</a>, then was hosted by <a href="#">Amy</a> in March, 2002. It is best viewed with 800x600 and Internet Explorer. Why 'Written in the Stars'? No clue, it was just some phrase I heard that I though sounded cool. Thanks to <a href="#">Getstring Guestbooks</a>, <a href="#">Hosted Scripts Counters</a>, and <a href="#">iXplorer FTP</a>. All layouts, buttons, etc, are made by me using <a href="#">Adobe Photoshop 5.5</a> and <a href="#">Adobe Image Ready</a>. Thanks SO much to <a href="#">Amy</a> for hosting me!<Br><br>

	<b>Layout:</b> I was looking for images for a layout on <a href="#">Tonystone</a>, and stumbled across the picture of a spraypaint can. I really liked it, so I took that image and with the help of a few brushes.. voila! The text was written with a brush. Look at the links page for a list of brushes sites. This layout took me about 10 minutes to make.. I think that's a record :]<br><br>
