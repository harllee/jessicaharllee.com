<div class="prose">

    
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/uberbryn">Bryn Jackson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_lovin">Brian Lovin</a> run <a href="http://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details">Design Details</a>, an interview podcast with designers. They came to Etsy to do a recording of a panel-style interview with me, <a href="https://twitter.com/jedmund">Justin Edmond</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/notdetails">Joel Califa</a>. It was super fun but a little scary—it was recorded in front of a live audience! I had a ton of fun talking about things like how we all became designers, management vs. individual contributor roles, and Neopets.</p>

      <p>I had the honor of writing an article for A List Apart on the role research can play as we make our way through the design process. I had been reading A List Apart and referencing it since the earliest days that I was building websites, so this opportunity was especially exciting to me!</p>

      <p>This week the project that I had been working on for the past nine months launched to an <a href="https://www.etsy.com/teams/21438/listing-management-prototype">open prototype</a>. It was a huge undertaking. It may be the hardest project I’ve worked on. It’ll easily be the most trafficked. I’m incredibly proud of the work my fantastic team and I did. And I’m proud of myself, but for slightly different reasons.</p>

      <p>Pricing your work is hard. Whether you’re a freelancer or you sell handmade goods, putting a value on something you’ve created is tough. It requires balancing a competitive rate with paying yourself what your time is worth, and for many people (myself included), it’s easy to undervalue your time.</p>

It’s a term I’ve heard used a lot and up until last week I thought I thoroughly understood. Etsy supports an environment of learning, people make mistakes, don’t point fingers, etc. All good things and things I believe in.</p>

Her last site ran on Wordpress, and while it made sense for her to use a CMS to manage her site, Wordpress wasn’t cutting it. After <a href="http://jessicaharllee.com/notes/a-redesign-with-siteleaf/">redoing my own site</a> with <a href="http://siteleaf.com">Siteleaf</a> and having a really good experience, we decided to give it a go.</p>

It’s at Appalachian Spring where I developed a passion for all things handmade. I credit my time there (among other sources) with my desire to support artists, which brought me to New York to work at Kickstarter over two years ago.</p>

      <p>The last time I redid my website was almost exactly two years ago. I was ready to leave my job and needed a refreshed portfolio. <em>(Side note: why are so many of us terrible about updating our websites unless we’re looking for a job?)</em> It had been a bit of time since I built a website from start to finish (designers at that company weren’t allowed to touch code), and I spent a three-day weekend proudly handcoding my brand new site. It was a completely static site with no templating and probably some terribly-written CSS, but it worked.</p>

<div class="prose">

    
      <p>Six months ago today I moved from a small town in southwest Virginia to New York City. I came up here with just a duffel bag, a suitcase, and a backpack. I slept on an air mattress in my friend’s living room in Bushwick for three weeks until I was able to move into an apartment in Brooklyn Heights. I sold my car, got rid of a third of my wardrobe, and moved to a city that’s basically the opposite of the place I had been living for the past six years. After working at a digital advertising agency for almost three years, I decided that I wanted to switch industries and quit my first job as an adult. To say my life has been full of changes in the past six months would be quite the understatement.</p>
