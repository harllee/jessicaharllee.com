	<h1 class="mb-sm-3">Pricing my embroidery</h1>


<div class="prose">

    
      <p>Pricing your work is hard. Whether you’re a freelancer or you sell handmade goods, putting a value on something you’ve created is tough. It requires balancing a competitive rate with paying yourself what your time is worth, and for many people (myself included), it’s easy to undervalue your time.</p>

<p>In the past few weeks I’ve had a few people reach out to me asking about how I price the items in <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/harllee">my Etsy shop</a>. I’ve posted my response to a convo from another embroidery seller on Etsy below. I don’t think I have pricing completely figured out (after all, my shop is only a year old and is only a part-time project), but I feel like I’m in a better place with pricing than I was <a href="http://jessicaharllee.com/notes/emoji-embroidery-a-post-mortem/">when I first sold my embroidery</a>.</p>

<hr class="b-gray-lightest mt-sm-4 mb-sm-4" />

<p>First, here are some posts that I found to be helpful:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.designsponge.com/2014/07/biz-ladies-why-cheap-can-be-bad.html">Why cheap can be bad</a> (Design Sponge)</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.etsy.com/en/2012/a-simple-formula-for-pricing-your-work/">A simple formula for pricing your work</a> (Etsy)</p>

<p>For my embroidered pieces, the materials are mostly negligible (under $10). It’s really the labor and the handmade factor that make me judge what they’re worth. Each piece takes about 5 hours start to finish to make. That doesn’t really translate to an hourly rate nicely; based on the pricing formula in that Etsy blog article, it’d be something like $5/hour, which seems rather low.</p>

<p>Instead, the way that I try and think about it is this: I don’t want them to be so cheap that just anyone can buy them, because they are special and handmade and involve quite a bit of labor. I also don’t want them to be so expensive that no one can afford them; after all, they’re only 4” tall so I need to be reasonable. I feel that the price point is accessible for someone who really feels strongly about having one, but also weeds out people for whom it’s a fleeting interest. I also need to price them at a point that makes it worth it for me to go through the effort of making them.</p>

<p>Most of my items linger around $60/70 per, but I do have a few items where I increase the pricing a lot. The shrimp emoji uses a lot of thread and requires a lot of effort to make, so it’s a lot more money. I also wanted a higher ticket item in my shop. Also, when I do custom orders, I charge much more than I would for the items in my shop because it requires creating a new pattern and doing a piece that I’ve never done before, which means it’s possible that I’d redo it a few times (this has totally happened to me). Sometimes the higher price drives people away, but I’m okay with that.</p>

<p>Also, for what it’s worth, I’ve been gradually increasing my prices over time. A year ago they were $20 or so cheaper, but as the demand has increased and as I’ve come to appreciate and respect their value, I’ve increased the prices.</p>

<p>Another thing that I want to point out is that I don’t do this for a living. I have a full time job in addition to doing this as a hobby, so I have the luxury of being more lenient on my pricing.</p>

<p>The biggest piece of advice I can give is that your work and your time are worth it!</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
