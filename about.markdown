I’m Jessica Harllee (she/her) and I'm a staff product designer. Most recently, I was at [Faire](http://faire.com), a wholesale marketplace connecting independent brands with local retailers. Before that, I was at [Primary](http://www.primary.com), a gender-non-prescriptive kids clothing brand, spent six years at [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/people/harllee) (mostly focused on tools for Etsy sellers), was on the founding design team at [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/harllee), and worked at [Modea](http://www.modea.com), an ad agency. I was born and raised in northern Virginia, studied Visual Communications Design at Virginia Tech, and have lived in Brooklyn for over a decade.

I own too much jewelry, listen to a [constant stream of music](https://open.spotify.com/user/jessicaharllee), and love a good craft project. I’m obsessed with process and a well-organized Google doc, and believe that great design is nothing without great copy. I’m probably shorter than you. Currently, my favorite emoji is the :spiral-eyes:.

I've been keeping a personal site since 2000, when I first learned HTML and CSS and discovered design. [Please enjoy a sampling of the old layouts here](http://jessicaharllee.com/archives).

One day I hope to ~~run a 10K~~ ([did it!](http://jessicaharllee.com/notes/balance)), ~~sell something that I make~~ ([did it!](http://jessicaharllee.com/notes/emoji-embroidery-a-post-mortem/)), do an unassisted handstand, write a book, and have a library of floor-to-ceiling bookshelves in my home.
